# Andromeda OS Kernel

Andromeda is a hand-designed operating system designed to be compatible with software written for Appleâ€™s macOS operating system. I have based it on open-source code published by Apple, and heavily edited it to make it function. This code, the kernel of Andromeda, is the only component of Andromeda that has been written as of yet. (A kernel is the lowest-level component of any operating system. Its function is to mediate access to hardware devices, as well as interaction between other programs.)

This repository contains the Andromeda kernel, `xnu`, and its immediate dependencies (software required for it to compile and run).

`xnu` is licensed under the [Apple Public Source License](APPLE_LICENSE).
