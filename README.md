# Kernel

This repository contains the Andromeda kernel, `xnu`, and its dependencies.

`xnu` is licensed under the [Apple Public Source License](APPLE_LICENSE).

## About This Branch

The `boot-fixes` branch contains my **work-in-progress** fixes towards the goal of booting `xnu` in a virtual machine. They do not work, but are too important to simply revert. Thus, I have committed them to a separate branch.
